# Project Description

My goal for this project is to collect TikTok user data, including usernames, followers, likes, and top viewed videos, and create visualizations to understand the user behavior and performance. To accomplish this, I'll use TikTok's public APIs to collect data and store it in Azure Blob Storage. Then, I'll use Databricks to process the data and Power BI to create the dashboards and visualizations.

Project Steps:

1. Data Collection:
First, I'll collect TikTok user data using TikTok's public APIs. I'll gather usernames, followers, likes, and top viewed videos. This data will be collected regularly and stored in Azure Blob Storage.

2. Data Processing:
Once I have collected the data, I will process it using Databricks. Databricks is a powerful data processing tool that can handle large datasets. I'll clean, transform, and aggregate the data as needed to create meaningful insights.

3. Data Visualization:
The next step is to create visualizations using Power BI. Power BI is a powerful tool that can create interactive dashboards, reports, and charts. I'll customize the visualizations to meet the specific needs of the project, such as showing the number of followers and likes for each user, the top viewed videos, and the trends over time.

5. Deployment and Maintenance:
Finally, I'll deploy the dashboards and visualizations to a web server or share them with stakeholders via email. I'll also maintain the project to ensure the data is up-to-date and accurate. I'll refresh the data on a regular basis and update the visualizations as needed to reflect the latest trends and insights.

Overall, this project will provide valuable insights into TikTok user behavior and performance. The dashboards and visualizations I create using Power BI will be easy to use and provide stakeholders with the information they need to make informed decisions.
